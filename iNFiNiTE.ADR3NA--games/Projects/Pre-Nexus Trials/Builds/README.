# 🧪 PRE-NEXUS TRIALS (Test Build)

Welcome to the **Pre-Nexus Trials**, an early, playable prototype designed as a testing ground for the future of the **ALONE** series.

This isn't just a rough demo — it's a functioning multiplayer FPS environment where players can **run, aim, shoot, pick up gear, and respawn** in real time.

---

## 🌟 What's This About?

This test build is all about:
- Developing and refining gameplay mechanics
- Stress-testing networking systems (multiplayer in progress)
- Getting feedback from players
- Having **real fun** while doing it

It’s a **sandbox for experimentation** and a **foundation for something bigger**.

> 🤝 Your feedback now helps shape what this game will grow into later.

## 🧭 INVENTORY SYSTEM

Click the inventory icon in the UI to:
- **Reload**
- **Use items**
- **Pick up items**
- **Manage your gear**

A Clean UI — it works. Once you're in, you’ll see how it’s evolving.

---

## 🎉 YES — It’s Playable

You can:
- **Jump in**
- **Shoot around**
- **Test movement & animation sync**
- **Pickup items
- **Respawn and keep playing**

And if you're playing with someone else on the network, things sync — **animations, damage, and state changes**.

It's not fully polished, but you could still have **fun** while it grows. Responsive, and built with intention.

## 📡 MULTIPLAYER & SERVER

Multiplayer is already active — and more server features are coming. This means:
- Competitive or co-op sessions
- Player feedback in live scenarios
- The game grows *with you* as you test it

## 🚧 Visuals?

- Stylized 2D characters (LIKE RETRO DOOM IN THE FUTURE)
- Clean UI (RESIDENT EVIL INSPIRED)
- Animated transitions
- In-progress death/resurrection VFX

The goal: **mechanics first, visuals next** — but yeah, **it's already a vibe.**

---

## 📌 Final Words

> Pre-Nexus Trials is the **testing phase before the storm**.

It lays the foundation for a larger vision — but even now, it’s something you can explore, have fun with, and shape through your input.

Thanks for playing 🖤
